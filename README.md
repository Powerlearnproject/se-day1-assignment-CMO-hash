Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the application of engineering tools in the development and maintaenance of software systems
Software engineering has been manipulated by different sectors such as the healthcare system to develop high quality technologies to better human experience.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Operating systems such as windows have been developed
Web applications such as instagram have been developed using artificial intelligence
Embedded systems such as automotive software have also been developed.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-This involves collecting what the system will require and user needs
Design-involves creating the architecture of the application and user interface
Implementation- using the architecture designed, a code is written
Testing- tests on the written code are run to ascertain that it has met the standard quality
Deployment-having met the qaulity standards,the end product is rolled out to the users
Maintenance-once deployed,updates are made over time to ensure the quality is still met

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall- the approach involves distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall.
Agile-This methodology involves an iterative approach involving changes that are built on a software

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes codes.
Quality assurance engineer- Inspects the quality of the software by coming up with tests for it.
Project manager- ressponsible for the planning and execution of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-contains great tools for writting code and testing it.An example is eclipse.
VCs- tools used to monitor changes on the original code.An example is GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing reuirements
Rushed development resulting in low quality software
Strategies include: Prioritization of tasks and agile methododlogies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- involves the testing of singular modules of the software
Integration- this involves the testing of the interactions between varied subsystems
System - involves testing the whole software
Acceptance- involves checking if it meets the consumer needs
These modes of testing help yield a high quality system since defects are noted early enough in the journey of development and corrected.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of giving instructions to AI models to come up with the best responses to the user.
It helps improves the interaction between AI models and humans.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about arrowroots
What are the health benefits of arrowroots?
The specific latter statement avoids ambiguity and helps come with concise and informational data.
